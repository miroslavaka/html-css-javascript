            <h4>Tulip</h4>
            <p>Tulips (Tulipa) form a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes (having bulbs as storage organs). The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm
                colors). They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history of cultivation, classification has
                been complex and controversial.</p>

            <h4>Orchidaceae</h4>
            <p>The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family. Along with the Asteraceae, they are one of the two largest families of flowering
                plants. The Orchidaceae have about 28,000 currently accepted species, distributed in about 763 genera.</p>

                can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.<sup>[1]</sup> Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.</p>

            <h4>Pansy</h4>
            <p>The garden pansy is a type of large-flowered hybrid plant cultivated as a garden flower.<sup>[1]</sup> It is derived by hybridization from several species in the section Melanium ("the pansies")<sup>[2]</sup> of the genus Viola, particularly
                Viola tricolor, a wildflower of Europe and western Asia known as heartsease. Some of these hybrids are referred to as Viola Ã— wittrockiana Gams ex Nauenb. & Buttler. For simplicity, the older name Viola tricolor var. hortensis is often
                used.
